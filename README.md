## Azure Data Pipelines: ETL Projects

This repository contains a collection of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline projects using Azure services. These projects demonstrate various ETL processes, including data copying from CSV files to SQL databases, creating triggers upon specific file uploads, and uploading backlog data through tumbling window triggers.

### Project Overview

1. **CSV to SQL Data Migration**: This project focuses on the extraction of data from CSV files and its subsequent loading into a SQL database. It demonstrates the capability of Azure services to handle structured data efficiently.

2. **Creating Triggers on File Upload**: This project showcases the creation of triggers in Azure. A trigger is activated when a specific file format is uploaded into the container, automating the process of data ingestion and further processing.

3. **Uploading Backlog Data through Tumbling Window Trigger**: This project involves uploading backlog data into a SQL database using a tumbling window trigger. It highlights the use of time-based triggers in managing and processing backlog data.
